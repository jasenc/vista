# Vista Helicopters

This is a professional one-page business website that I am developing. Currently
the project is on hold as a result of the customer being away on business for an
extended period of time. This website is estimated to be completed in Fall of
2015.

In the meantime a preview is available at [Vista](http://www.jasencarroll.com/vista/). Please note that this preview was simply developed to
express and agree upon the design and layout, additionally it is all filler information and not to be taken seriously.

The website is lacking the following:

* Actual content
* Working contact form
* JS/jQuery animation of the Image Gallery
* Website optimization - including but certainly not limited to code cleanup.

## Technologies Used

At the moment I am using this website to develop my own personalized front-end boilerplate. Currently it is a combination of
[HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) and the [Bourbon Stack](http://bourbon.io/). I plan on developing the Image Gallery myself, however we all know how that goes when time becomes crucial and there are so many well developed frameworks/jQuery plugins available.

Finally I hope to use a simple Python or Ruby script to handle the contact form and deliver a much nicer experience to my customer than the standard HTML5 output.
